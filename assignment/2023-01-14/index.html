      The <b>angry man</b><u>jumped out of his car</u>and grabbed the closest
      noy and yelled."what was that?What the hell have you done to my car? Why
      did you do that?"The boy was very scared but extremely polite. and
      apologized. "sorry, sir I didn't know what else to do," he said."<u
        >I had to throw bricks because no one else would stop to ask for my
        help."</u
      >With tears rolling down his cheeks. He pointed to the parked cars and
      said
      <b
        >"this is my brother, he rolled forward and fell from the wheelchair,
        and he is seriously injured. I cannot life him."</b

        >He is injured and too heavy for me. "He quickly lifted the other boy
        from the place and put him back in the wheelchair. He also helped the
        boy with his bruises and cuts.

        he looked at the bulging door of his car. The damage was very
        noticeable. but he didn't bother to repair it. He help the money to
